    <p>
      I had the opportunity to tutor three wonderful kids in my last quarter at Stanford through the Haas Center's Ravenswood Reeds
      and Preschool Counts programs. One of my kids was also graduating preschool at the start of June, so I made this
      book as a graduation gift, inspired by the storytelling and counting games we were taught in class. It follows a little goose
      on the day of their own preschool graduation!
